📘 NumPy Learning Repository

Welcome to my NumPy learning journey!
This repository contains all my practice programs, notes, and experiments while learning NumPy, the core library for numerical computing in Python.

🚀 What I Learned
✔️ NumPy Basics

Understanding ndarray

Creating arrays (list, zeros, ones, arange, linspace)

Array shapes, dimensions, and data types

✔️ Array Operations

Element-wise operations

Matrix operations

Broadcasting

Universal functions (ufuncs)

✔️ Indexing & Slicing

Basic slicing

Boolean filtering

Fancy indexing

✔️ Math & Aggregations

sum(), mean(), min(), max()

Axis-wise operations

Statistical functions

✔️ Reshaping & Manipulation

reshape(), flatten(), ravel()

Stacking (hstack, vstack)

Splitting arrays

✔️ Working with Real Data

Loading and saving arrays

Basic numerical analysis

Performance advantage using vectorization
